Description : "Our" Program is a simulated weather cycle using a finite state machine that models a 7 day weather pattern that includes:
States like Clear, Cloudy, Raining, and Severe Weather.
Events like Getting Warmer, Getting Colder, Humidity Increasing and Wind Increasing.
Flow transitions with the technical requirements Clear <-> Cloudy <-> Raining <-> Severe Weather 

Team : Monet K, "Sarai F", "Camille O", "Ken Y"

How to run: Running the program displays the 7 day weather simulation, and 5 weather transitions for the given day. The program simulates weather events randomly each time.
